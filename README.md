# mc-integrate

`mc-integrate` provides a small Python script for n-dimensional Monte Carlo integration. I'll document stuff if/when I'm done. It is based on an improved version of the simple stochastic integration function I wrote for, of all things, my high school English class. You can see the original post [here](https://blog.ericzheng.org/_posts/2019-01-22-monte-carlo-integration/).
